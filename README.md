## Repository for description of problem with branches and it's solution (i hope)

I checked my branches master and main
There are similar files are displayed when I enter command "git status" in both branches. However, when i'm in the folder homework_http_fork the command git status display me branch pushkareva.

When I decide check repository in rpm-hws_7-2_2023 I discovered that I have branch puskareva under parent branch main

How I can link my branch to main?
